            <div class="alignJustify width100per">
                Background checks have changed a great deal in just the past couple years, due to
                the increasing computerization of vital records, as well as to challenges associated
                with a difficult economy. Here’s are some of the top trends:

                <ul class="ulDiscType">
                    <li class="marginTop5">New Laws around Marijuana Usage<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">There are many laws covering background checks, including
                            With nearly 19 states legalizing the usage of marijuana thus far the question remains
                            is it ok by employer if an applicant who uses is subjected to drug test? Many companies
                            may have an existing policy that prevents hiring individuals with negative background
                            checks. What’s more, a person with a pot bust in Colorado or Washington may try
                            to move to a new state and find a job, and when that past conviction shows up, that
                            employer in the new state may find it irrelevant that the pot laws were changed.

                    <li class="marginTop5">Dishonesty in Applications and Resumes<br />
                     <span class="font_weight_normal">The recession
                        of 2008 resulted in many more unemployed people taking longer and longer to secure
                        jobs. As the challenge to find work increased, so did the temptation to stretch
                        the truth on job applications and resumes. Over the past five years, employers in
                        all industries have reported a marked increase in the number of cases where job
                        applicants were less than truthful. </span></li>
                    <li class="marginTop5">Increased Relocation Across State Lines<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">People don't stay in one place as much as they used
                            to. Between traveling for work, school, and employment, people are moving across
                            state lines more than ever before. Background checks become more challenging to
                            perform as more applicants change lcations. </span></li>                   
                    <li class="marginTop5">More International Employees<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">The labor force isn't just fluid within the United
                            States. Many people are working both domestically and abroad. As such, collecting
                            information from outside the U.S. can be difficult and time-consuming. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="marginTop5">Stricter Privacy Laws<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">In the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, new laws
                            have been enacted restricting the amount of data that can be maintained on someone;
                            as well as legislating who has access to that data and what it can be used for.
                            Three states prohibit using credit-report information for making hiring decisions.
                            Similarly, the federal government prohibits credit-reporting agencies from going
                            back more than seven years to obtain a credit history on an individual. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="marginTop5">Checking Social Networking Sites<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">It has become a common practice for employers to review
                            Facebook pages and other social networking sites to prescreen candidates for employment.
                            However, some states are curbing this practice. In Maryland, Illinois, and California,
                            for example, it's illegal to ask job candidates for passwords to their online accounts.
                        </span></li>
                    <li class="marginTop5">Integrating Background Checks with Other HR Systems<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">Many background check providers use the service as
                            one element of a larger human resources (HR) system. For example, many trucking
                            companies purchase not only an initial background screening on drivers, but also
                            one that checks every month for traffic violations-whether these infractions occurred
                            on the job or off. Some HR systems automatically flag data in a report that is beyond
                            a threshold set by the company, thereby eliminating the need to scrutinize screening
                            reports on candidates who fail to meet minimum qualifications. </span></li>
                    <li class="marginTop5">E-Verification of Employment Eligibility<br />
                        <span class="font_weight_normal">Perhaps the simplest type of background check is to
                            determine whether an applicant is qualified for employment in a particular state.
                            Many states have set up electronic verification (e-verify) systems so that employers
                            can quickly check the accuracy of a Social Security number, as well as whether or
                            not the candidate can be legally employed. </span></li>
