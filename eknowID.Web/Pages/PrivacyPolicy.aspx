                OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES</h1>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
              At eKnowID, we place priority on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers’ personal information. Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our products and services and with entrusting your personal and background information to us. We do not sell or rent your information to anyone, and we do not share your personal information with anyone outside of eKnowID.com for promotional and/or marketing use. We do not make your background information available to anyone, including anyone at eKnowID.com for any marketing purpose.</p><br />
            <b>We protect your personal and background information</b>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
           We work to protect your personal information and background information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards, coupled with carefully developed security procedures and practices. We also use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as personal information or credit card information, we support the encryption of your information as it is transmitted to us. Our employees and agents are trained and required to safeguard your information.</p><br />
            <b>We tell you how we use your personal information</b>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
                When we ask you for personal information, we will tell you, or it will be clear from the site, what information is required to fulfill your request and how we will use it. For example, if you order a product or register for a service from us, we will ask you for your name and contact information such as, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. 
            </p>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
                In order to help you monitor the accuracy of your background check records, we need to collect sufficient information for us to conduct a background check for you.   For this reason, we need to collect birth date and social security number information. We provide your personal or background information to third parties upon your specific request.</p>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
              In addition to responding to your requests and providing products and services to you, we may use your contact information to tell you about products or services we think might interest you or to invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey. Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from minors.</p><br />
            <b>We tell you about our relationships with third parties</b>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
              We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, such as fulfilling customer orders or providing other services. These service providers are limited by contract to appropriate use and handling of your personal and background information, and prohibit those third parties from using any of your personal or background check criminal record information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted.</p>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
              Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of and safeguard the information we provide to them. Additionally, we have business partners who provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request.</p>
            <p class="alignJustify width95per">
              We may disclose your personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required under the law, or to protect you or others. For example, we may be required to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement action, or comply with discovery in civil litigation, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrants.  Finally, we may disclose personal information as part of an actual or contemplated purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets).</p><br />
