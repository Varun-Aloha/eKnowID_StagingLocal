            <p>
                Employers are doing it. Daters are doing it. Even the government is doing it. So
                what is the "it" we're referring to here? Background checks. With nearly 75 percent
                of all employers now choosing to conduct background checks on all employees, the
                popularity of and the technology involved in conducting such searches continues
                to grow. And with many college graduates preparing to transition from campus to
                cubicle, it's important they understand these requirements and prepare for a litany
                of checks during their job hunt..

                With data sources riddled with outdated and inaccurate information, it’s imperative
                to be informed. eKnowID has successfully created a way to provide peace of mind
                to recent graduates and job seekers — at least when it comes to background checks.
                I’ll be having a daughter soon, and it’s comforting to know that it will be easier
                to do background checks on her boyfriends in the future..

            <p>
               Do you trust all the information on a CV? Background checking companies want to ensure you can, and in some cases are passing the power to the candidates.
Organisations are now providing tools to both employees and recruiters to ensure more informed background checks are being carried out.. Two US companies – eKnowID and Acertiv - are taking different approaches to ensuring the validity and usefulness of background checks and CVs.
Through eKnowID, candidates can obtain background checks on themselves, giving them foresight into what a prospective employer could obtain. The service allows employees to become aware of information about them that may be false – eg criminal records due to identity theft or slanderous reports..

            <p>
                At least a couple of companies, neither too well known yet, have a different take
                on abackground check: they’re having job candidates take a turn in the driver’s
                seat when it comes to the whole process. First there’s eKnowID. Candidates use it
                to “conduct a comprehensive and thorough HR self-background check prior to the scrutiny
                of a prospective employer.” One advantage for candidates is they can challenge something
                that’s wrong before an employer does the check and mistakenly thinks the employee
                has a red flag in their past. The company is a division of KENTECH Consulting, a
                Chicago background check technology company..

                Background checks are becoming more common in the hiring process. EKnowID allows
                users to do background checks on themselves so they are aware of how they will appear
                to hiring managers. The company believes that such information should be available
                to individuals as well as corporations. U.S. background checks are completed within
                72 hours and international checks take about 2 weeks..
